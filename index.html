                    <p> Animefest+ 2025 on 19th April was our first date and cos date together. We experienced many enjoyable memories here.
                        From the Arcade, the artist alley, the cookie shop or the rooftop. Especially the heartfelt letter you gave me, it tore me to pieces right there and there in the MRT itself.
                        My favourite part is when we were at a cookie shop and there was a bell with the sign "ring for kiss". You didn't see the
                        sign at first and rang it but stopped after Ankle told you about it. while I didn't saw the sign and kept on ringing the bell because of my childish ahh hehe

                    <p> IOI city mall was out first time out together in a non cosplay environment. We went to watch Ejen Ali the movie 2 together
                        (alongside Jay). After watching the movie we went to the Ice Skating rink where I taught you how to skate properly (after your 17 years of living).
                        It was also one of your first reuniting with Jay after not being able to see her for a long time. As long as your happy
                        , i'm happy.

                <p> Our stubbornness brought us to this memory. You were sick but still kept implying on going.
                    Since you were sick, you went to the event in a casual outfit (non-cos) while I was cosplaying 
                    as Scara. So basically you were living your dreams luls. We bought many stuff and you met some of my schoolmates and classmates.

                <p> It was the release of a long awaited Anime movie. Demon Slayer Infinity castle. EVERY Cinema were booked
                    except KLCC. I ordered us a movie ticket at 11am and it was early as heck, so I had to fasten your arrival time by using a Grab
                    rather than an MRT (how I went to KLCC). During the date we also went to buy our favourite ice cream (orea mcflurry). Subsequently,
                    we went on a walk at the KLCC park to recreate my favourite memory of you before I started dating you during Comic Fiesta 2024.
                    After finishing up we went to Pavillion Bukit Bintang to wrap things up with a blast at a Karaoke and photobooth.

                <p> A double date with Jay & Kas at One Utama mall. We spent most of the time being lost there-
                    We went to play bowling together for 2 rounds, and went to find a Karaoke right after. It took us a tiktok search to find
                    it as it was hidden beside the arcade, though it was really Luxury-ish. We had our fun and also got a unintended 'discount' where we sang
                    for 3 hours even though we paid for 2 hours. Let's also not forget the screaming challenge at Pasar Seni.

                <p> One of the best Comic Fiesta I ever had, spent with you. one of our biggest groups as well including Jay, Kas, and Ungku.
                    Originally planned for two days but due to unforseen circumstances I had to go home early. but that doesn't stop it from being
                    an unforgettable memory. We spent the night together at an Airbnb for CF. We spent an actual full day together without seperating (yippie).
                    and we did many tiktoks together inside of CF. On another note, We're matching as KazuScara. Well, WanKazu technically.
                    but it's similar to our 'Accidental' KazuScara on Comic Fiesta 2024. :D
